# neiss

The neiss package provides access to all data (2009-2014) from the [National Electronic Injury Surveillance System](http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/), which is a sample of all accidents reported to emergency rooms in the US.

It currently contains three datasets:

* `injuries`: individual injury results
* `products`: product code lookup table
* `population`: population of the US by age, sex, and year

Inspired by [flowing data](http://flowingdata.com/2016/02/09/why-people-visit-the-emergency-room/).
